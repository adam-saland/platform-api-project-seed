# Example: Child Window Modal

This example uses an OpenFin Child Window to replicate standard web modal behavior. Press the button to show the modal, an overlay is shown on the Parent Window to indicate it's inactive and also user movement / event propogation is disabled in the Parent Window until the Child Window modal is closed.

- `npx create-openfin-app --example app-child-window-modal my-example` 
- Install and run:
```
cd my-example
