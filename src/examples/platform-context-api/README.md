# Example: Platform Context API

This example uses the [OpenFin Platform Context API](https://developers.openfin.co/docs/recipes-platform#section-context-sharing) to share context between Views within Platform Windows. Open up the left-menu and select Colors to create the Views that show off this behavior by sharing a background color with each other.

## How to use

Execute `create-openfin-app` to bootstrap the example.

- `npx create-openfin-app --example platform-context-api my-example` 
- Install and run:
```
cd my-example
npm install
npm start
```
